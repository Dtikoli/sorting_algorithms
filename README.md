This respository contains projects on Sorting Algorithms and Big O Notation. The following are covered:
1. At least four different sorting algorithms
2. What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
3. How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
4. What is a stable sorting algorithm
